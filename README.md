# Peugeot Sports Race Prediction Project

This repository is for the Peugeot Sports Race Prediction Project using PySpark. In this project, I have built a machine learning model to predict whether a driver will finish a race or not in the world of car racing. It was imagined that Peugeot Sports has invested in new car development and a racing academy and is seeking insights to optimize their investments.

## Project Overview

Peugeot Sports is venturing into car racing and needs to predict race outcomes. My task is to create a machine learning model that can forecast whether a driver will complete a race. I have used FOrmula One historical race data for analysis and prediction.

## Project Goals

1. **Data Understanding:** Understand the provided data on previous races and the factors that can impact a driver's race completion.

2. **Model Building:** Construct a machine learning model using at least two different algorithms to predict race outcomes. Compare and evaluate the performance of these models.

3. **Model Comparison:** Compare the performance of the developed models and identify which one performs best.

4. **Prediction:** Utilize the best-performing model to predict the outcomes for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix for 2018. Provide probability estimates for each participating driver.

## Output

This repositry contains  the following 

- A report comprising an executive management summary and a technical overview 
- A notebook with code to execute the assignment in Databricks.
